# How to run the code
Our method is implemented in "result.py"
Let **train_path** be the path to "Ten-Year-Demand.csv" and **test_path** be the path to the test data (CSV file).
(The paths are without quatation marks.) <br>
For example, if "Ten-Year-Demand.csv" is placed in the same folder as "result.py", test_path would be "./Ten-Year-Demand.csv" (when you enter it, remove the quatation marks). <br>
On the command prompt, enter
```
python result.py train_path test_path
```
